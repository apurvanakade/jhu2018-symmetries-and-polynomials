## Symmetries \& Polynomials

I taught this 2-week class in the winter break (intersession) of 2018 at JHU.
This class introduces non-math majors to group theory and its connections to roots of polynomials, in particular, the unsolvability of the quintic.
The class is designed in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.
The prerequisites are basic proof techniques.
